### Hi there ;)

Here's my stack: **Python**, **SQL**, **Django**, **Flask**, **Asyncio**, **PostgreSQL** and so on.  
I also have experience with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and have gently touched **C** and **Racket** with dreams about **Rust**.  

Iâ€™m currently learning **Nginx** and **Docker** to run my website, and playing with **Alembic**, **Fast API** and **Postman**.  

I love the **console environment** and created a *beautiful app* with [**collections of games**](https://github.com/zluuba/games-of-terminal) for this space.  
Now, I'm working on a **real-time chat app for the console**.  

**âš¡ Fun fact**: I really need a job, so it would be really nice to get an offer from you. Thank you in advance!

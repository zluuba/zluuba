My stack: **Python**, **Django**, **Flask**, **Asyncio**, **SQL**, **Docker**, **Nginx**.  
I also have experience with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and have gently touched **C** and **Racket**. 

Currently, I'm playing with **Fast API**, **Alembic** and **Pydantic**.  

I love the **console environment** and created a _beautiful app_ with [**collections of games**](https://github.com/zluuba/games-of-terminal) for this space.  
Now, I'm working on [**my website**](https://zluuba.art) and a **real-time chat app for the console**.
